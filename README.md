To reproduce the results please do the following:
1) Download South Building dataset from here https://colmap.github.io/datasets.html and convert its data using COLMAP to binary format.

2) Choose the checkpoint you want to use: [checkpoints_sh](checkpoints_sh) or [checkpoints_md](checkpoints_md) the first one is both for visual and qualitative evalution, but provides slightly worse results. The second one is for qualitative evalution only and will require you to change some code in order to make it work.
